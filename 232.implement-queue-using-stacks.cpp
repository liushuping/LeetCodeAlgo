 *
 * Implement the following operations of a queue using stacks.
 * 
 * 
 * push(x) -- Push element x to the back of queue.
 * pop() -- Removes the element from in front of queue.
 * peek() -- Get the front element.
 * empty() -- Return whether the queue is empty.
 * 
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * 
 * MyQueue queue = new MyQueue();
 * 
 * queue.push(1);
 * queue.push(2);  
 * queue.peek();  // returns 1
 * queue.pop();   // returns 1
 * queue.empty(); // returns false
 * 
 * Notes:
 * 
 * 
 * You must use only standard operations of a stack -- which means only push to
 * top, peek/pop from top, size, and is empty operations are valid.
 * Depending on your language, stack may not be supported natively. You may
 * simulate a stack by using a list or deque (double-ended queue), as long as
 * you use only standard operations of a stack.
 * You may assume that all operations are valid (for example, no pop or peek
 * operations will be called on an empty queue).
